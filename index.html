It was one or the other, and I nearly always moaned about the hot summers, then the cold winters, well, it was cold, wasn't it? The kind of cold that chills the bones.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="24"><p>I walked the narrow streets amidst the peace, the quiet, with the sun on my face and the breeze on my back. Turn after turn down twisty streets I tried to find a place. That place from yesterday. I bet I would know better if I lived here, if I breathed the same air and swam in the same water as her. Then I could find her.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="25"><p>All the streets looked the same, and I should have taken pictures of the roads, but clever clogs here wasn't thinking. I was too busy, too excited about my new friend and what she might look like in a wedding dress. Big church or small? Registry office, a few close friends. Confetti or rice? I never understood throwing rice, it's not like there was a curry to follow, and rice in your eye isn't exactly the way I want to spend my afternoon, in casualty, with my beloved, pulling rice out of our eyes, ears, nostrils and all the other places they end up.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="26"><p>I stopped, and turned halfway, walking back the way I came, then, turned back. I'm sure it was this way I muttered. I stopped again and closed my eyes. I waited for the breeze to carry her scent to me, as though I was owed it because I was a good and decent man. That fragrance, that sweet, sweet, what was it called? Something Italian, something…bellissima. All I could smell was the salt coming off the sea, with a faint whiff of seaweed, and goats.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="27"><p>No.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="28"><p>Pine.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="29"><p>Yes, that’s it. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="30"><p>There was a subtle scent of pine trees.

Si, bene grazie. I didn't know much else but this well practised ice breaker was bound to impress, or surprise her, or maybe both. Would she be impressed enough to want to spend the afternoon with a lost tourist, enough to make me secretly hear wedding bells and wonder what our children would look like?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="32"><p>I trod on a sharp stone, I yelled, I cursed, I swore like only a true blooded Brit could. It hurt, a lot and now shattered everything. I was hot, lost, sweaty, and annoyed. I could call out her name, but that would be a little crazy. I don't want her thinking I was stalking her or desperately trying to find her. I would style it out, be all casual. Fancy meeting you here, again! In my favourite place in all the world!</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="33"><p>Twat.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="34"><p>Me, not her.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="35"><p>Yesterday she wore this print dress, cream and flowery, it accentuated her curvy figure; it had a wonderful dark green vine print from top to bottom. I marvelled at the details on the leaves, how intricate they looked, light and shade, twisting, turning, and I was convinced each piece of vine was unique. She laughed and thought me a strange Englishman so wrapped up in her dress rather than in what was in her dress. I gulped and smiled shyly, I was speechless. There was no blood left in my head for me to come back with something clever. Then I told her if I talked of emotions I would be lost, I would stumble, trip, fall, and make a fool of myself. That's why her dress fascinated me.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="36"><p>We walked and she placed her arm in mine. She was happy, quiet and the silences between us were of the blissful comfortable kind. When we sat and ate gelato, her vanilla and chocolate, me with pistachio mint and chocolate, she showed a little cleavage, which made my ice cream melt.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="37"><p>Her tan was just perfect, like the birds I cooked in the oven at Christmas, with rosy tender cherry tomato lips, and that sweet smell of…at first I thought she smelled of basil, but you can't say that to a woman, can you?</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="38"><p>Basil!</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="39"><p>I turned a sharp right and hurried along, now it was going steeper uphill, I looked at the damp patches under my arm. Maybe she won't notice, but then I did at my slight ripening. Surely that’s considered manly in these parts, because I'm so close, I can’t risk losing my way and… Maybe the sweat of my persistence, with a hint of desperation, will endear me to her. Don't run, walk, maybe if I walk with my arms up the hot air will dry me out.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="40"><p>Breathe.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="41"><p>Don’t hyper-ventilate.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="42"><p>So I walked with my arms up, gently flapping, wishing for the breeze to carry away my stale odour, and trying not to hold the bewildering eyes of the natives.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="43"><p>The basil was getting stronger.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="44"><p>Then I heard her voice from behind.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="45"><p>Ciao bello!

My Myers Briggs Test Type (MBTI) is <em>INTJ</em>and I am 17 years old.</p><p><strong>Socially: </strong>It is pretty screwed up. I can't get along with kids in my school or other people around me. Also, it is an INTJ characteristic that people perceive me as arrogant; in fact I am very humble. I tend to be the silent one. I don't
    talk much and sometimes I am shy. Similar to<a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-O-Church">Michael O. Church</a>, I don't talk to people in my age group, but instead have friends who are older than me. I also don't believe in small talk;
    I don't want people calling me unless it is extremely important and I think a real conversation is better any day.</p><p>However, When I am with like-minded people or in a place where I can discuss ideas, I am good socially and I consider myself to be an ambivert contrary to the MBTI test. I am swift then. Also, I am good at reading people's expressions and know what they
    are thinking about, but sometimes I don't even know that they are listening to me.<br>I despise smartphones, any and every form of communication. I don't use my smartphone quite a lot and I might switch to a feature phone. Also, I permanently deleted
    my facebook account after joining Quora. I don't keep up with my old buddies.</p><p><strong>Intellectually: </strong>At an early age, I discovered that I was passionate about robotics and computers. Also I am a voracious reader. I read, think and talk about subjects ranging from Neuroscience to metaphysics. I am good at school now. I
    love to be intellectually engaged. I have a hard time doing dull work, but I motivate myself and do work well. As for music, I find solace in classical works of Beethoven, Chopin, Tchaikovsky and the likes.</p><p>The dark side of this intellectual prowess is that I sometimes have to deal with analysis paralysis and I tend to over-plan things. I think and worry a lot, sometimes. Other times I get lost in my imagination; when I am inactive I tend to do thought experiments
    and try to analyze or build things in my mind.</p><p><strong>Creativity:</strong> My mind has an inclination towards abstraction; I would study the fundamental nature of something, make assumptions and inferences and would try to build an abstract model. I would then try to<em>use</em>that model. That is
    why I love robotics. I love to work on abstract stuff; I would do stuff with Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning and then use these domains to develop robots. Abstraction and Application, I work on these constantly.</p><p><strong>Practicality: </strong>I was a strong idealist earlier; now I believe that practicality and idealism should go hand in hand. With my idealistic mind, I made many mistakes. I learnt from those mistakes and take my decisions wisely now. I analyze
    the situations I am in, anticipate outcomes and know what will be beneficial for me. I do not have the Dunning Kruger effect, I know what I am good at, I know what I am bad at and I know that I don't know much.</p><p><strong>Procrastination:</strong> If I don't have a plan, I will procrastinate, a lot. I need to make a plan a night before. That is the only way I can be productive. I don't really need to be motivated to do something; having a purpose is enough. The
    next best thing would be a plan. Although I don't follow a plan rigidly but I keep working on things till bed time. I constantly make day logs and edit my plan, and I have a good work ethic. I am a non-conformist and brutally rational. I do not care
    about what others think about me, but I do not harm them either. If my apathy harms them, then I am in a dilemma.</p><p>[<strong>Note</strong>: Whatever I am or whatever I think, I do not attribute it to my IQ. Whatever I have achieved is by devoting time and effort in order to enhance my skills. I believe regardless whether your IQ is 100 or 140, you can achieve solely
    by practicing and improving your skills;<em>a priori </em>intelligence is just because of genes and environment. You can be anything you want.</p><p>Also, People cannot be compared; there might be millions of people intelligent than you, millions dumber than you. If you want to get ahead embrace who you are. Be unique, do something only you can and discover your real potential.]</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-dbabe29f-36ec-48a4-8ac0-bbbe218ec9c4" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="51"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="52"><h1>Something beautiful</h1><article>

    <p>As the plane makes its gradual descent you see much of the island from your window: the cliffs at one end, the long golden curve of a remote beach, olive groves, an isolated village, a patch of woodland, the ferry wharf constructed in the 1970s, the
        whitewashed air traffic control tower.</p>
