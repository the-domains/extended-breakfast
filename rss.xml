            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The surprising secret to speaking with confidence | Caroline Goyder </h1><p>I don't watch a lot of TED, I tend to dip in and out depending how much time I have, but found this one interesting. It gets better as she gets further into her talk, and the end bit is nice, that's what got me, which is why I liked it. Very interesting, I just hope I can remember it when I need it!</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e9cdd0309c99d76c0ce917c64474263b/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.youtube.com%2Fvi%2Fa2MR5XbJtXU%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Sea of Colour</h1><p>I was taking a photo walk with a good friend, Cameron, in Regent's Park on a nice Bank Holiday Monday. The flowers and park are wonderful, and we had a thoroughly good time wandering around taking pictures. It was a little windy, but that didn't stop us too much.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ee766dce9ba2fb34faf6ba1ab44085025295a844.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Underfoot]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Underfoot</h1><p>I went for a walk in Morden Hall Park today as the weather was perfect. For those who don't know, it's in south London at the end of the Northern Line, and is a beautiful place. Underfoot were some amazing colours; the pink, yellow and greens just looked too lovely not to capture. I love walking outdoors with camera in hand, just taking in the natural beauty, getting away from the city, and reminding myself that there are incredible things out when we venture out. Look up, look down, look everywhere, absorb, breathe in, breathe out, enjoy, and love everything.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/460cd3bf53f6f2eb96e3e557b605c5dad5cdc574.jpg"></article>]]></description>
