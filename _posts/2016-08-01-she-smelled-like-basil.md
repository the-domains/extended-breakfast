# She smelled like basil

The sun blazed down, it was so hot, the humidity was killing me, but it was one of those days where there would be gusts of cool air to grab you just in time before you fainted, or moaned about the extreme heat. It was one or the other, and I nearly always moaned about the hot summers, then the cold winters, well, it was cold, wasn't it? The kind of cold that chills the bones.

I walked the narrow streets amidst the peace, the quiet, with the sun on my face and the breeze on my back. Turn after turn down twisty streets I tried to find a place. That place from yesterday. I bet I would know better if I lived here, if I breathed the same air and swam in the same water as her. Then I could find her.

All the streets looked the same, and I should have taken pictures of the roads, but clever clogs here wasn't thinking. I was too busy, too excited about my new friend and what she might look like in a wedding dress. Big church or small? Registry office, a few close friends. Confetti or rice? I never understood throwing rice, it's not like there was a curry to follow, and rice in your eye isn't exactly the way I want to spend my afternoon, in casualty, with my beloved, pulling rice out of our eyes, ears, nostrils and all the other places they end up.

I stopped, and turned halfway, walking back the way I came, then, turned back. I'm sure it was this way I muttered. I stopped again and closed my eyes. I waited for the breeze to carry her scent to me, as though I was owed it because I was a good and decent man. That fragrance, that sweet, sweet, what was it called? Something Italian, something...bellissima. All I could smell was the salt coming off the sea, with a faint whiff of seaweed, and goats.

No.

Pine.

Yes, that's it. 

There was a subtle scent of pine trees. I squinted in the sun and looked. I think that road down there looks familiar. Was it really this steep yesterday? I wish I took more notice of what was going on outside of my bubble.

Her name was Valentina. Ciao Valentina, come stai? Tutti bene? Si, bene grazie. I didn't know much else but this well practised ice breaker was bound to impress, or surprise her, or maybe both. Would she be impressed enough to want to spend the afternoon with a lost tourist, enough to make me secretly hear wedding bells and wonder what our children would look like?

I trod on a sharp stone, I yelled, I cursed, I swore like only a true blooded Brit could. It hurt, a lot and now shattered everything. I was hot, lost, sweaty, and annoyed. I could call out her name, but that would be a little crazy. I don't want her thinking I was stalking her or desperately trying to find her. I would style it out, be all casual. Fancy meeting you here, again! In my favourite place in all the world!

Twat.

Me, not her.

Yesterday she wore this print dress, cream and flowery, it accentuated her curvy figure; it had a wonderful dark green vine print from top to bottom. I marvelled at the details on the leaves, how intricate they looked, light and shade, twisting, turning, and I was convinced each piece of vine was unique. She laughed and thought me a strange Englishman so wrapped up in her dress rather than in what was in her dress. I gulped and smiled shyly, I was speechless. There was no blood left in my head for me to come back with something clever. Then I told her if I talked of emotions I would be lost, I would stumble, trip, fall, and make a fool of myself. That's why her dress fascinated me.

We walked and she placed her arm in mine. She was happy, quiet and the silences between us were of the blissful comfortable kind. When we sat and ate gelato, her vanilla and chocolate, me with pistachio mint and chocolate, she showed a little cleavage, which made my ice cream melt.

Her tan was just perfect, like the birds I cooked in the oven at Christmas, with rosy tender cherry tomato lips, and that sweet smell of...at first I thought she smelled of basil, but you can't say that to a woman, can you?

Basil!

I turned a sharp right and hurried along, now it was going steeper uphill, I looked at the damp patches under my arm. Maybe she won't notice, but then I did at my slight ripening. Surely that's considered manly in these parts, because I'm so close, I can't risk losing my way and... Maybe the sweat of my persistence, with a hint of desperation, will endear me to her. Don't run, walk, maybe if I walk with my arms up the hot air will dry me out.

Breathe.

Don't hyper-ventilate.

So I walked with my arms up, gently flapping, wishing for the breeze to carry away my stale odour, and trying not to hold the bewildering eyes of the natives.

The basil was getting stronger.

Then I heard her voice from behind.

Ciao bello! Come stai?

And I collapsed with heat stroke in a happy pile in front of her.
