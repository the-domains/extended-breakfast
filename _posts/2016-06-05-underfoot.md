  I went for a walk in Morden Hall Park today as the weather was perfect. For
  those who don't know, it's in south London at the end of the Northern Line,
  and is a beautiful place. Underfoot were some amazing colours; the pink,
  yellow and greens just looked too lovely not to capture. I love walking
  outdoors with camera in hand, just taking in the natural beauty, getting away
  from the city, and reminding myself that there are incredible things out when
  we venture out. Look up, look down, look everywhere, absorb, breathe in,
  breathe out, enjoy, and love everything.
